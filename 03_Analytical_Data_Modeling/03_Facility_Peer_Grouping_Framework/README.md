# Facility Peer Grouping Framework

## What This Is

This document defines the **facility peer grouping framework** used across the project to ensure that hospital benchmarking, KPI interpretation, and executive reporting are **clinically fair, statistically meaningful, and industry-aligned**.

Peer groups are a core part of the analytical data model and directly influence how KPIs such as Length of Stay, Mortality, Cost, and Payer Mix are interpreted. Peer grouping is model configuration, not KPI logic.

## Scope

This framework:
* Defines the official peer group taxonomy (PG-A through PG-E)
* Populates the Dim_PeerGroup dimension
* Assigns facilities to peer groups via a factless bridge table
* Enforces strict, deterministic matching to canonical facility names

It does not:
* Perform KPI calculations
* Modify fact tables
* Apply fuzzy matching or heuristic joins

---

## Why Peer Grouping Is Required

In healthcare analytics, comparing hospitals without adjusting for **role, acuity, and service mix** leads to false conclusions.

Industry best practices (CMS, AHRQ, Vizient, HFMA) consistently show that performance metrics are structurally driven by:

* Teaching vs non-teaching mission
* Tertiary referral responsibilities
* Case mix severity
* Specialty concentration (cardiac, rehab, neuro)
* Rural vs urban operating constraints
* Safety-net obligations

This framework ensures that:

* High-acuity hospitals are not penalized
* Small hospitals are not distorted by volatility
* Specialty hospitals are not diluted into general peers
* Executives can trust KPI signals

---

## Design Principles

The peer groups defined here follow five strict principles:

1. **Role over ownership**
   Health system branding is irrelevant for benchmarking. Hospital function is what matters.

2. **KPI-specific applicability**
   Not every peer group is valid for every KPI.

3. **Clinical plausibility**
   Groupings reflect real referral patterns and care pathways.

4. **Statistical stability**
   Groups avoid low-denominator volatility where possible.

5. **Executive defensibility**
   Every grouping decision can be explained in one sentence to leadership.

Peer groups are **mutually exclusive as definitions**, but facilities may belong to **multiple peer groups** if required by future analysis.

### 2. `dbo.Bridge_Facility_PeerGroup`

**Grain**  
One row per Facility–PeerGroup assignment.

**Role**  
Resolves the many-to-many relationship between facilities and peer groups.

**Columns**
- `Facility_Key`
- `PeerGroup_Key`

This table contains **no measures**.  
It exists solely to propagate peer-group filter context through `Dim_Facility` to all KPI fact tables.

---

---

## Seeding Logic  
`seed_dim_peergroup_and_bridge.sql`

The seed script performs two controlled operations:

### 1. Populate `Dim_PeerGroup`

- Uses `PeerGroup_Name` as the natural key
- Uses `MERGE` for idempotent re-runs
- Maintains sort order and active flags

### 2. Populate `Bridge_Facility_PeerGroup`

- Resolves `Facility_Key` exclusively via `dbo.Dim_Facility`
- Resolves `PeerGroup_Key` exclusively via `dbo.Dim_PeerGroup`
- Inserts only validated Facility–PeerGroup pairs

---

## Canonical Facility Name Requirement (Important)

Facility-to-peer mappings are resolved using **exact equality** on:

```sql
Dim_Facility.Facility_Name
```

This is intentional.

#### Why strict matching is enforced
* Prevents silent misclassification
* Forces a single source of truth for facility naming
* Surfaces data-quality issues early
* Avoids fragile LIKE, fuzzy, or normalized joins

If a facility name in the peer-mapping list does not exist in Dim_Facility,
no bridge row is created.

This behavior is by design.

---

### QA Expectations

After running the seed script, the following must be true:
* All peer groups exist in Dim_PeerGroup
* All mapped facilities exist in Dim_Facility
* The bridge contains only valid foreign keys

#### Recommended QA check

```sql
SELECT m.Facility_Name
FROM (VALUES (...)) AS m(Facility_Name, PeerGroup_Name)
LEFT JOIN dbo.Dim_Facility f
    ON f.Facility_Name = m.Facility_Name
WHERE f.Facility_Key IS NULL;

```

## KPI-to-Peer-Group Applicability

Not all peer groups are valid for all KPIs. The table below defines which peer groups are used for each KPI.

| KPI | PG-A Academic / Tertiary | PG-B Large Community | PG-C Mid-Size Community | PG-D Rural / East-End | PG-E Specialty-Dominant |
|-----|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| **KPI 01 – Length of Stay** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **KPI 02 – Unplanned Admission Proxy** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| **KPI 03 – Severity Mix Index** | ✓ | ✓* | ✓* | ✓ | — |
| **KPI 04 – Payer Mix** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| **KPI 05 – Disposition Outcomes** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **KPI 06 – Mortality** | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| **KPI 07 – Cost per Encounter** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

**Notes:**  
- ✓* = PG-B and PG-C are interpreted as a combined *Community Hospital* comparator set for Severity Mix.  
- “—” indicates the peer group is intentionally excluded to avoid distortion or statistical instability.


---

## Downstream Usage (Power BI)

* Dim_PeerGroup is exposed as a slicer
* Filters propagate via  
  `Dim_PeerGroup → Bridge_Facility_PeerGroup → Dim_Facility`
* All KPI measures automatically evaluate Facility vs Peer Group context

No peer logic exists in DAX.
Peer group logic is **never embedded ad hoc** in KPI SQL. It is treated as a **semantic modeling layer**.

---

## Known Limitations

* Peer groups do not eliminate the need for clinical judgment
* Small hospitals may still exhibit volatility on rare events
* Specialty overlap may evolve over time

These limitations are acknowledged explicitly to prevent misuse of metrics.

---

## Summary

This framework ensures that all hospital performance metrics in this project are:

* Fair
* Comparable
* Clinically grounded
* Executive-ready

It is a foundational component of the analytical data model, not a visualization convenience.
