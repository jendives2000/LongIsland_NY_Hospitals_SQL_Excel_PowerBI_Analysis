# 06.01 — Fact KPI SQL (Semantic Model Layer)

This folder defines the **KPI fact tables** that form the core of the **Power BI semantic model**.

It represents the transition from:
- KPI *logic & validation* (Step 05)
to
- KPI *governance-ready facts* consumed by Power BI, Excel, and downstream analytics.

## What This Folder Contains

This folder contains **one production fact table per KPI**, each implemented as:

- A **dedicated T-SQL file** (`Fact_KPI_*.sql`)
- A **clearly defined analytical contract**:
  - explicit grain
  - stable numerators and denominators
  - conformed dimensions
- A structure optimized for:
  - Power BI star schema modeling
  - Excel pivot reconciliation
  - auditability and governance

**Important:**  
This README documents *what each fact represents*.  
All SQL implementation details live in their own `.sql` files.

## Design Principles (Healthcare Analytics Standards)

All Fact_KPI tables follow these rules:

- **Explicit grain** (no ambiguity)
- **One KPI per fact table**
- **Facility-anchored aggregation**
- **Discharge-year alignment** across KPIs
- **No embedded business logic in Power BI**
- **Reconciliation-safe metrics**
- **Conformed dimensions reused across facts**

This ensures:
- consistent interpretation across dashboards
- safe Excel validation
- future extensibility (new years, new facilities)

### Additivity Notes
- All authoritative KPIs are derived from additive components.
- Non-additive values (averages, rates, indexes) are computed in Power BI as measures.
- Columns suffixed with `_validation` exist only for SSMS and reconciliation and are hidden in Power BI.

## Relationship to Power BI Semantic Model

These fact tables are:
- **Imported as facts** in Power BI
- Related to **conformed dimensions**:
  - `Dim_Facility`
  - `Dim_Date`
  - `Dim_Payer`
  - `Dim_Disposition`
- Used to build:
  - certified measures
  - executive dashboards
  - Excel-connected pivot models

No business logic is duplicated in Power BI.

---

## Change Management Rule

This folder defines the **executive KPI contract**.

Any change requires:
1. SQL versioning
2. Excel reconciliation
3. Power BI model update
4. README update

Unversioned KPI changes are not permitted.
