# How to Read This Hospital Performance Report  
**Executive Guide (1-Page)**

## What This Report Is — and Is Not

This report helps leadership **understand where hospitals are under pressure** and **why**.

It is:
- A **decision-support tool**
- A **signal-detection system**
- A way to separate **structural realities** from **true performance issues**

It is **not**:
- A hospital ranking
- A scorecard
- A judgment of care quality in isolation

Correct interpretation depends on **reading the pages in order**.

## One Core Rule (Read This First)

> **Context must be reviewed before performance.**

Severity, intake mix, and hospital role **shape every downstream metric**.  
Skipping context pages leads to incorrect conclusions.

---

## How the Report Is Structured

The report follows the real hospital care flow:

**Who we treat → How patients arrive → How long they stay → Where they go → Outcomes → Financial pressure**

Each page answers **one executive question only**.

---

## How to Navigate the Pages (In Order)

### 1️⃣ Severity Mix (Patient Complexity)
**Question:** Are patients sicker here?

- Shows how complex the patient population is
- Higher severity explains higher cost, longer stays, and higher risk
- This page provides **context only**, not performance

> Do not interpret any outcome or cost without this page.

---

### 2️⃣ Unplanned Admissions (Intake Pressure)
**Question:** Is pressure driven by emergency intake?

- High unplanned intake strains beds, staff, and flow
- High rates are expected in trauma, referral, and safety-net hospitals
- This explains downstream congestion

> Read before Length of Stay or Cost.

---

### 3️⃣ Length of Stay (Throughput)
**Question:** Are patients staying longer than expected?

- Longer stays increase cost and reduce capacity
- LOS must rise with patient severity
- Flat LOS across severity levels is a warning sign

> LOS without severity context is misleading.

---

### 4️⃣ Disposition Outcomes (Where Patients Go)
**Question:** What happens after discharge?

- Home vs post-acute care vs transfers vs death
- Higher post-acute use often reflects patient complexity
- Explains downstream cost and capacity impact

---

### 5️⃣ Mortality (Outcome Risk)
**Question:** Do death rates align with patient risk?

- Mortality is rare but high-impact
- Always shown with encounter counts
- Small hospitals may show volatile rates

> Rates without volume are unreliable.

---

### 6️⃣ Cost & Margin Pressure (Financial Stress)
**Question:** Is care financially sustainable?

- Shows cost per patient and cost vs charges
- Indicates **financial pressure**, not profitability
- Must be interpreted with LOS and severity

---

### 7️⃣ Payer Mix (Structural Financial Risk)
**Question:** Is pressure operational or reimbursement-driven?

- Shows who pays for care
- High Medicaid or self-pay share reflects mission, not inefficiency
- Explains structural financial strain

---

## How to Use Comparisons Correctly

- Hospitals are compared **only within peer groups**
- Differences across hospital roles are expected
- Large differences *within* a peer group are meaningful

> Peer context is mandatory for fair interpretation.

---

## Common Misinterpretations to Avoid

- “High cost means inefficiency” → often false  
- “High mortality means poor care” → context required  
- “Low LOS is always good” → may reflect case mix  
- “Negative margin means bad management” → often payer-driven  

---

## What This Report Enables

When used correctly, this report helps leadership:
- Identify **where pressure originates**
- Separate **structural vs operational issues**
- Focus investigations where they matter
- Make fair, defensible decisions

---

## Bottom Line

This report tells a **connected story**.

Skipping pages breaks the story.  
Context first. Outcomes second. Conclusions last.
