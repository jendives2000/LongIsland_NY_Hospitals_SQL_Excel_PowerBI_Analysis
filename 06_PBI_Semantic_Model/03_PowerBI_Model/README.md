# 06.03 — Power BI Semantic Model

This folder documents the **Power BI semantic model** built on top of the
validated KPI facts (`06.01`) and governed dimensions (`06.02`).

It represents the transition from:

- **SQL-defined KPI contracts**
to
- **Certified analytical consumption** in Power BI and Excel

This is where business logic becomes **measures**, relationships are enforced,
and executive-safe analytics are exposed.

The Power BI semantic model is implemented as a Power BI Project (.pbip) to enable:
* source control
* explicit relationship management
* and governed measure versioning

## Purpose of This Step

The purpose of `06.03` is to implement a **clean, deterministic, and governed**
Power BI semantic model that:

- faithfully represents SQL KPI contracts
- prevents metric drift
- supports **both Power BI dashboards and Excel pivot analysis**
- is safe for executive self-service

This step answers the question:

> *How do we expose complex healthcare KPIs in a way that is accurate,
> reproducible, and usable by non-technical decision-makers?*

---

## What This Folder Contains

This folder documents:

- the **Power BI data model structure**
- relationship rules between facts and dimensions
- the **measure layer design philosophy**
- how KPIs are safely consumed in:
  - Power BI dashboards
  - Excel (via Analyze in Excel / PivotTables)

**Important:**  
No SQL logic lives here.  
All transformations are upstream (Steps 04–05).

---

## Semantic Model Design Principles

The Power BI model strictly follows these principles:

1. **Star schema only**
   - No snowflaking
   - No fact-to-fact relationships

2. **One KPI = one fact table**
   - Matches `Fact_KPI_*` design from `06.01`

3. **Dimensions are conformed**
   - Exactly as documented in `06.02`
   - No KPI-specific dimension variants

4. **No business logic in visuals**
   - All logic lives in measures
   - Visuals only consume certified measures

5. **Excel-safe by design**
   - No ambiguous filters
   - Deterministic aggregation behavior

---

## Model Structure Overview

### Fact Tables

The semantic model imports the following **KPI fact tables**:

| Fact Table | KPI Purpose | Grain |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `Fact_KPI_SeverityMix` | Clinical acuity context | Facility–Year |
| `Fact_KPI_PayerMix` | Payer distribution & risk | Facility–Year–Payer |
| `Fact_KPI_Unplanned` | Acute intake pressure | Facility–Year |
| `Fact_KPI_Disposition` | Discharge outcomes | Facility–Year–Disposition |
| `Fact_KPI_LOS_Summary` | Length of stay behavior | Facility–Year |
| `Fact_KPI_Mortality` | In-hospital mortality | Facility–Year |
| `Fact_KPI_FinancialPressure` | Cost & margin stress | Facility–Year |

Each fact:
- is imported at its **authoritative grain**
- contains only **additive components**
- does **not** store final KPI rates as authoritative values

---

### Dimensions

All facts connect to the conformed dimensions documented in `06.02`:

- `Dim_Date`
- `Dim_Facility`
- `Dim_Payer`
- `Dim_AdmissionType`
- `Dim_Disposition`
- `Dim_ClinicalClass` (selective usage)

No dimension logic is duplicated or redefined in Power BI.

---

## Relationship Rules (Non-Negotiable)

The following modeling rules are enforced:

- **One-to-many** relationships only  
  (Dimension → Fact)

- **Single-direction filtering**
  - Prevents ambiguous paths
  - Ensures Excel pivots behave predictably

- **No bi-directional filters**
- **No fact-to-fact joins**
- **One active date relationship per fact**
  - Anchored on **Discharge Date**

Violating any of these rules invalidates KPI certification.

---

## Fact ↔ Dimension Wiring (Keys + Attributes)

> Relationship pattern: Dim[PK] (1) → Fact[FK] (*), single-direction.
> Date is anchored on Discharge: Fact.Discharge_Date_Key → Dim_Date.Date_Key

| Fact Table | Fact FK (column) | Dimension | Dim PK | Common Dim Attributes to expose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fact_KPI_SeverityMix | Facility_Key | Dim_Facility | Facility_Key | Facility_Name |
|  | Discharge_Date_Key | Dim_Date | Date_Key | Year, Quarter, Month, Month_Number |
|  | ClinicalClass_Key (optional) | Dim_ClinicalClass | ClinicalClass_Key | APR_Severity_Code, APR_Severity_Description, APR_Risk_Of_Mortality_Desc |
| Fact_KPI_PayerMix | Facility_Key | Dim_Facility | Facility_Key | Facility_Name |
|  | Discharge_Date_Key | Dim_Date | Date_Key | Year, Quarter, Month, Month_Number |
|  | Payer_Key | Dim_Payer | Payer_Key | Payment_Typology_Group, Payment_Typology_1 |
| Fact_KPI_Unplanned | Facility_Key | Dim_Facility | Facility_Key | Facility_Name |
|  | Discharge_Date_Key | Dim_Date | Date_Key | Year, Quarter, Month, Month_Number |
|  | AdmissionType_Key (optional) | Dim_AdmissionType | AdmissionType_Key | AdmissionType_Std |

| Fact_KPI_LOS_Summary | Facility_Key | Dim_Facility | Facility_Key | Facility_Name |
|  | Discharge_Date_Key | Dim_Date | Date_Key | Year, Quarter, Month, Month_Number |
|  | ClinicalClass_Key (optional) | Dim_ClinicalClass | ClinicalClass_Key | APR_Severity_Code, APR_Severity_Description |
| Fact_KPI_Mortality | Facility_Key | Dim_Facility | Facility_Key | Facility_Name |
|  | Discharge_Date_Key | Dim_Date | Date_Key | Year, Quarter, Month, Month_Number |
|  | Disposition_Key (optional) | Dim_Disposition | Disposition_Key | Disposition_Grouped |
|  | ClinicalClass_Key (optional) | Dim_ClinicalClass | ClinicalClass_Key | APR_Severity_Code, APR_Risk_Of_Mortality_Desc |
| Fact_KPI_FinancialPressure | Facility_Key | Dim_Facility | Facility_Key | Facility_Name |
|  | Discharge_Date_Key | Dim_Date | Date_Key | Year, Quarter, Month, Month_Number |
|  | Payer_Key (optional) | Dim_Payer | Payer_Key | Payment_Typology_Group |

## Measure Strategy

### Additive vs Derived Measures

**Authoritative data in the model is additive.**

Examples:
- Encounter_Count
- Total_Costs
- Total_Charges
- Death_Count
- Unplanned_Encounter_Count

All **rates, averages, and indexes** are computed as **DAX measures**.

This guarantees:
- correct aggregation at any slice level
- Excel and Power BI consistency
- auditability

---

### Certified KPI Measures

Each KPI exposes **certified measures**, such as:

- Severity Mix Index
- Unplanned Admission Rate
- Average LOS
- Mortality Rate
- Average Medical Cost per Encounter
- Margin Pressure Ratio
- Payer Share (%)

Rules:
- Measures are documented
- Measures are reused across visuals
- Visuals do **not** recompute logic

Hidden columns:
- SQL validation fields
- pre-computed averages
- reconciliation helpers

---

## Excel Compatibility & Executive Access

This semantic model is intentionally **Excel-first compatible**.

Executives can:
- connect using **Analyze in Excel**
- build PivotTables
- slice by Facility, Year, Payer, Disposition, etc.
- trust that totals and rates reconcile with Power BI

Why this matters:
- Many executives prefer Excel
- Excel is still the dominant executive analysis tool
- A governed semantic model enables **safe self-service**

Power BI becomes the **same truth**, just visualized differently.

---

## Governance & Change Control

Any change to the Power BI semantic model requires:

1. Upstream SQL change (Step 05)
2. Excel reconciliation (Step 06.05)
3. Measure impact review
4. README update
5. Re-certification of affected KPIs

No ad-hoc measures.
No silent changes.

---

## Relationship to Other Steps

- **06.01 — Fact KPI SQL**  
  Defines the authoritative KPI data contracts

- **06.02 — Dimensions Reference**  
  Defines the slicing vocabulary and keys

- **06.03 — Power BI Model**  
  Implements relationships and measures

- **06.05 — Validation**  
  Confirms Power BI results reconcile with Excel and SQL

---

## Final Principle

> **SQL defines truth.**  
> **The semantic model enforces it.**  
> **Power BI and Excel merely consume it.**

This step ensures that executive insight is built on
**discipline, not convenience**.
